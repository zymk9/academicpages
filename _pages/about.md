I an a final year undergraduate student from the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) as well as the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/) in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST). I major in both Computer Science and Data Science. My research interests mainly focus on photorealistic rendering and high-quality real-time rendering, especially on combining deep learning with appearance modeling, light transport, and differentiable rendering. My interests span to geometry processing, simulation, and vision as well.

I am fortunate enough to collabroate with [Prof. Pedro Sander](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~psander/) on reprojection scheduling and perception-guided VR rendering acceleration, and with [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=chi-keung-tang-cktang) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFhLmFkAAAAJ) on object detection in Neural Radiance Fields.
