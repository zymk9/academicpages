I am an incoming graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and currently a final year undergraduate student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST), with major in both Computer Science and Data Science. My research interests mainly relate to photorealistic rendering, high-quality real-time rendering, and 3D vision. I am particularly interested in combining deep learning with appearance modeling, light transport, and differentiable rendering, as well as bridging 3D vision and differentiable rendering for better 3D content generation, capturing, and editing. I am also interested in broader domains in graphics and vision.

I am fortunate enough to collabroate with [Prof. Pedro Sander](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~psander/) on reprojection scheduling and perception-guided VR rendering acceleration, and with [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=chi-keung-tang-cktang) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFhLmFkAAAAJ) on object detection and instance segmentation in Neural Radiance Field.
