I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a degree in Master of Science in Computer Science. I received my Bachelor's degree at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, with major in both Computer Science and Data Science. My research interests encompass photorealistic real-time rendering, differentiable rendering, and 3D vision. I am particularly interested in bridging 3D vision and graphics via differentiable rendering for better 3D content generation, capturing, and editing. I am also interested in applying deep learning to appearance modeling, light transport, as well as broader domains in graphics and vision.

I am very fortunate to collabroate with [Prof. Pedro Sander](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~psander/) on reprojection scheduling and perception-guided VR rendering acceleration. I was also supervised by [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=chi-keung-tang-cktang) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFhLmFkAAAAJ) on object detection and instance segmentation in Neural Radiance Field.
