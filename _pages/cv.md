Technical projects
======
* [Metarenderer](https://zymk9.github.io/Metarenderer/)
  * An educational tool for introductory graphics courses based on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and WebGL, featuring interactive visualization of camera models, basic shading models, lighting, culling, textures, and shadow mapping.
  * Advanced features include **PCSS, microfacet models, and PRT with interreflection and glossy BRDF.**
  * Used in the teaching of COMP 5411 Advanced Computer Graphics, at HKUST.
  * Supervisor: *[Prof. Pedro Sander](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~psander/)*, Dept. CSE, HKUST.

* [Trace](https://github.com/COMP4411-Team/Trace)
  * A soft renderer supporting path tracing, GGX microfacet BRDF, and photon mapping.
  * Course project of an introductory graphics course.

* [PLM-KGE](https://github.com/zymk9/PLM-KGE)
  * Explored the extrapolation behaviours, inference patterns, and embedding distributions of pretrained language model-based knowledge graph embedding.

* [Yet-Another-Anime-Segmenter](https://github.com/zymk9/Yet-Another-Anime-Segmenter)
  * Developed a deep learning-based instance segmentation model for anime characters based on CondInst and SOLOv2, achieving best performance among open-source solutions at the time released.
